# Patches for the Scalable SGX attacks

## Linux SGX driver patches

This folder contains the patches for the [out-of-tree Linux SGX driver](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver).

* `linux-sgx-driver.patch`  
  Modifies the legacy SGX driverâ€™s EPC allocation to ensure all pages reside in regions unaffected by the interposer, allowing enclaves to run while the interposer is active. Additionally, it adds an interface to request a specific EPC page at a given physical address. This functionality is used, for example, to allocate an attacker EPC page that aliases with a victim EPC page.
  > [!NOTE]  
  > This patch includes hardcoded physical addresses, which may need to be adjusted based on the installed DIMMs and the physical-to-DRAM address mapping of your system.
* `linux-sgx-driver-lepubkeyhash.patch`  
  Ports FLC support to the out-of-tree kernel module.
* `linux-sgx-driver-vm_flags.patch`  
  Updates the driver to compile on kernels version 6.3 and above.
